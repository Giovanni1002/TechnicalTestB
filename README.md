Main Design Decisions The architecture follows a strict  OOP approach, separating concerns into Controllers, Services, Tools, and Schemas. I implemented a RagController to act as the central point of this app. controllers in this case responsible for initializing infrastructure connections and assembling the LangGraph workflow. I also make Search and Save document to tools so its can be used for different services. that both the Search and Upsert tools operate on the exact same data source, preventing data silos while abstracting the storage complexity away from the business logic. Also uuid is used for th unsafe id replacement

Trade-offs Considered One significant trade-off was implementing the In-Memory Fallback mechanism for the vector database. While this increases code complexity—requiring conditional logic in the tools to switch between Qdrant and a Python list—and introduces data volatility, I chose this approach to prioritize developer experience and the easy setup. It allows the application to run immediately in a local environment without requiring a Docker container or external database instance. 

Maintainability Improvements This version significantly improves maintainability through Decoupling and the Single Responsibility Principle. By moving logic out of a single script into dedicated classes (SaveDocument handles storage, ChatService handles prompt logic, EmbeddingService handles vectors), future changes are isolated; for example, switching from Qdrant to Pinecone would only require updating the Tools layer and the client connection, leaving the Controller and API routes untouched. and then the use of Dependency Injection makes the system highly testable, as we can easily inject mock memory lists or fake database connections during unit testing without messing up the production code.
